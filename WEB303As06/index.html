        <div class="accordion-panel">
            <p>On December 28, 1937, Ratan Tata was born in Bombay, which is now Mumbai, under the British Raj. He is the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted into the Tata family after being born in Surat, and Sooni Tata, who is the niece of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata group. Hormusji Tata, Tata's biological grandpa, was a blood relative of the Tata family. When Tata was ten years old in 1948, his parents divorced, and he was taken in and reared by his grandmother, Navajbai Tata, who was also Ratanji Tata's widow.</p>

        <h3>Career</h3>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
            <p>Tata received a promotion to manager within the Tata group in the 1970s. His early success came from turning around the National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) division, but amid a recession, the company failed. He was named J. R. D. Tata's successor after he resigned from his position as chairman of Tata Sons in 1991. At first, Tata encountered strong opposition from the leaders of several subsidiaries, who had considerable operational autonomy during the older Tata's leadership.
